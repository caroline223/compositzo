            <h1>What is a Journal Prompt?</h1>
            <p>
                A journal prompt is a written statement designed to inspire you or offer you an idea of what to write about.
                This does not take into account your love of, or lack of writing. Rather, it is to encourage you to document your thoughts and feelings 
                safely within a private manner. Prompts are great for helping beginning writers get into journal writing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Basic journal prompts can be used by anyone to help get past a temporary block. The best journal prompts inspire you to look deep inside yourself for inspiration, 
                and to discover and capitalize on some of the hidden thoughts and ideas you hadn't previously recognized or even considered. With practice, you can develop the ability to find inspiration in everything you see. 
                But, when you're just getting into journal writing, or when you're really stuck, these suggested journal prompts can be very helpful.
